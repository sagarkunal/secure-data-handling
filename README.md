step-by-step guide for creating an environment setup in PyCharm to run a Python project:

✅ Step: Setting up the environment in PyCharm

# Open PyCharm
Launch PyCharm and open your project or create a new one.

# Configure Python Interpreter

Go to File → Settings (on Windows/Linux) or PyCharm → Preferences (on macOS).

Navigate to Project: [your_project_name] → Python Interpreter.

# Create a New Virtual Environment

Click the gear icon ⚙ next to the interpreter dropdown.

Choose Add... → Virtualenv Environment.

Select a location (default is inside your project folder, e.g., venv).

Choose the base interpreter (Python executable installed on your system).

Optionally, check Inherit global site-packages if you want access to system packages.

Click OK to create the environment.

# Activate the Environment
PyCharm will automatically activate the new environment for your project. All packages installed will be confined to this environment.

# Install Required Packages

Click the + icon in the Python Interpreter window to install packages like requests, flask, etc.

Alternatively, use the terminal in PyCharm:

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Verify the Environment

Open the Terminal tab in PyCharm and run:

python --version


to ensure the correct interpreter is active.

Run your script to confirm the environment is properly configured.

# Save Configuration

The environment setup is saved in the project settings.

You can share requirements.txt by running:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
